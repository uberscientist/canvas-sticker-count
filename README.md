Canv.as Sticker Grapherer
========================

Enter a canv.as username, then watch the results roll in.

How to get this to run:
------------------------
 - You'll need to download <a href='http://nodejs.org/'>node.js </a>
 - You'll also need to have this database running <a href='http://www.redis.io/download'>Redis</a>

 - And you'll need to use Firefox to run this locally, Chrome(-ium) has issues because of a security feature.

 - Now open a terminal and `cd` into the directory with `app.js`
 - `npm install`, this command installs the packages the program relies on.
 - After that is done `node app.js`
 - Open `index.html` with Firefox, and that should be it!
